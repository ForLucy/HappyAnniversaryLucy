    	<p class = "message">Happy one year anniversary!!! It's crazy to think how a whole year has passed since I met you, but I guess that's one way I can tell that I'm spending it with the right person. You're always there for me whenever I'm feeling down or stressed with PA's or physics homework and I really hope I can be there for you too when your stressed. I love spending time with you for so many reasonss. I like walking with you because you make the sunset so much prettier, I like getting food with you because we always go to like 3 different places and it's so much more fun and tastier with you, I like watching movies with you because your predictions are always so amazing to hear, like your actually more accurate than my memory of the movie hahaha, I love going on runs with you because we always end up having really fun conversations or run into bugs with their butts connected haha, I love making food with you because your always just super impatient and excited to eat and it's so cute, I love when I go to another room or something and you ask to "come with", and I love just being with you because your so pretty, and I wouldn't trade the way you look at me for anything.</p>
    	<p class = "message"> Over this past year, you've taught me so much about growing and becoming a better person. I learned to care for someone else. I know you said you don't think so, but I really do think I grew up as a selfish person. I don't think I do a good job about looking out for others, but with you I think I'm finally learning to see things from perspectives other than my own and help. I've never really had any type of relationship where I did things for other people, and I think being with you has made me a kinder person, to my friends, sister, and mom, and I really appreciate you for that. I'm learning to be more productive and responsible, taking my school work more seriously and being better with my time management. I mean it's still not great but It's a lot better and I'm still working on it. I think I'm becoming more of an adult because of you haha so thank youu. I want to be someone you can rely on, and that has taught me to keep my word more and follow through on things I set out to do. I know I still have a lot of learning and maturing to do, but I'm glad that I can do it with you. I think your very mature and I really appreciate having someone like you to learn from. I know over the course of our relationship we have ups and downs and we argue sometimes, but I really appreciate how peaceful you are and I know sometimes I can lose my cool so I admire how understanding and forgiving you are, a lot of times I realize I've been rude or mean and I feel really bad but you never hold it against me after I apologize and I don't even know how you're capable of doing that. I hope I can become even half as tolerant as you.</p>
    	<p class = "message">I remember you once said that you always make really nice looking cards for other people, but you don't really get them back, and I felt really bad because I didn't ever do anything artsy to make a nice looking card and I don't really think I can unless you count origami haha, but I really wanted you to have something unique so I hope you like the card I coded even though it's still really simple. I really want you to know that I care about you and will continue to care about you in the future to come. I hope you have a wonderful day filled with good food and fresh strawberries :) I love you</p>
